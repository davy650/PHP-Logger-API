# phpEventLogger
An event logger API using pure PHP - no frameworks

In this project, i have developed a stand alone API to assist in centalization of logging. The API is purely in PHP using Object Oriented principles and NO FRAMEWORKS!! 

The application is built on basic onion architecture with dependency inversion principle. Feel free to suggest any better way or do it in your own prefered method.
